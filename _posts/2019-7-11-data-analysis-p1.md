### Why we need learn Data Analysis 

- More and more data in daily life and work

- Truth usually is hidden under large amount of data

- Most of businesses are driven by data 

### The steps to do Data Analysis 

- Understand and define the problem

- Identify data source and collect sample data to know data format

- Data ETL setup

- Processing the data 

    - Illegal value remove
    - Missing treatment 
    - Remove duplication

- Build model and verify the model based on the defined problem 

- Result visualization & generate conclusion report


### Tools for Data Analysis 

- Python

- Shell/awk/sed

- Juypter-notebook

### Modeling algorithms in Data Analysis  

- Regression algorithms

    - linear regression 
    - logistic regression

- Classification algorithms

    - Native Bayes 
    - Decision tree 

        - Random forest
        - Gradient boost tree
        
    - Neural network
    - SVM(support vector machine)

- Recommendation algorithms

    - association rule
    - similar item detection 
    - personalization 
    
### The successful way to learn Data Analysis

- *Learn* : learn theory & tools
- *Practice* : play the tools and examples  
- *Taking notes* : close the book, and summary what you have learn and what you think
- *Sharing* : Convert the knowledge into your own language and share with others
